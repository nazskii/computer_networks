     <h1>Fiber Based Systems</h1>
     <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Fiber-based systems in telecommunications use thin strands of glass or plastic to send information as light signals. This technology allows for super-fast internet speeds and can carry much more data than regular copper wires. Because fiber optics are less affected by interference and can send signals over long distances without losing quality, they are great for connecting homes, schools, and businesses. So, whether you're streaming videos, playing online games, or doing homework, fiber optics help make those connections work smoothly and reliably.</p>
       <h2>Function</h2>
     <p>Fiber-based systems in telecommunications work by sending data as light signals through thin strands of glass or plastic known as optical fibers. When you want to transmit information, it gets converted into light pulses. These pulses travel through the fiber, bouncing off the walls to keep the light moving in the right direction. This allows the signals to travel long distances without losing quality. When the light reaches its destination, it is converted back into electrical signals that devices like computers and smartphones can understand. This technology enables fast internet speeds and efficient communication over long distances.</p>
