     <h1>Computer Networking/Overview</h1>
     <h2>Networking Components</h2>
      <p>Networking components are the building blocks that allow our devices to communicate and share information seamlessly. Think of routers, switches, and modems as the traffic managers of the digital world, guiding data where it needs to go while keeping everything secure with firewalls. Together, these elements create a connected environment that makes it easy for us to access the internet, share files, and stay in touch with one another.</p>
       <h2>Network Adressing</h2>
     <p> Network addressing is the system used to assign unique identifiers to devices on a network, enabling them to communicate effectively. The most common forms are IP addressing, which uses numerical labels (like IPv4 and IPv6) to identify devices on the internet, and MAC addressing, which assigns a unique hardware identifier to each network interface. Together, these addressing methods ensure that data is accurately routed to the correct destination, facilitating seamless communication between devices.</p>
      <h2>Network benefits</h2>

Networking brings people together by making communication and collaboration effortless, which can really boost productivity in both personal and professional settings. It allows us to easily access and share important information while keeping it secure, and as our needs grow, networking makes it simple to expand and adapt. Ultimately, it enhances our connections and helps us work more efficiently, making our lives a little easier and more connected.</p>
       <h2>Network types</h2>
      <p>There are several types of networks designed for different purposes. A Local Area Network (LAN) connects devices within a small area, while a Wide Area Network (WAN) spans larger distances, such as the internet. A Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) links networks within a city, and a Personal Area Network (PAN) connects personal devices over short distances. For secure remote access, a Virtual Private Network (VPN) encrypts data, while a Storage Area Network (SAN) provides efficient access to consolidated data storage in enterprises. Lastly, a Cloud Network connects users to scalable cloud services over the internet. Each type plays a vital role in enhancing communication and resource management.</p>
