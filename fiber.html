     <h1>Fiber Based Systems</h1>
     <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Fiber-based systems in telecommunications use thin strands of glass or plastic to send information as light signals. This technology allows for super-fast internet speeds and can carry much more data than regular copper wires. Because fiber optics are less affected by interference and can send signals over long distances without losing quality, they are great for connecting homes, schools, and businesses. So, whether you're streaming videos, playing online games, or doing homework, fiber optics help make those connections work smoothly and reliably.</p>
