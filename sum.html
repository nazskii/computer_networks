   <h1>Summary</h1>
   <ul>
     <li>Fiber Based Systems</li><p>Fiber-based systems are all around us, using both natural and synthetic fibers in everyday products like clothing, medical devices, and even the internet. These fibers can be tailored for specific needs, making them strong and flexible for various applications, from cozy sweaters to high-tech communication cables. As we become more aware of our environmental impact, there's a push for sustainable practices, leading to exciting innovations like biodegradable materials and smart fibers that can adapt to their surroundings, highlighting the incredible versatility of fiber technology in our lives.</p>
     <li>Copper Based Systems</li><p>Copper-based systems use copper wires to send data and voice signals. Twisted pair cables are used for phone lines and local networks, while coaxial cables are used for cable TV and internet. Although they are affordable and common, these systems can lose signal quality over long distances and may experience interference. Despite this, copper is still a popular choice for communication, especially in areas without newer technologies like fiber optics.</p>
     <li>Wireless Based Systems</li><p>Wireless-based systems let us send data and voice signals without needing any cables, using things like radio waves, microwaves, or infrared signals instead. This means that devices like smartphones, tablets, and laptops can connect to the internet and talk to each other from just about anywhere, making our lives a lot more convenient. However, while wireless technology is great for flexibility, it can sometimes struggle with distance, obstacles, or interference, which can weaken the signal and affect our connections.</p>
