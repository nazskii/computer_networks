     <h1>Welcome to Computer Networks</h1>
     <p>Computer networks are systems that connect our devices, enabling them to communicate and share information, ranging from small local area networks (LANs) in homes or schools to the vast internet that links millions of networks worldwide. These connections can be organized in various ways, such as a star topology, where all devices connect to a central hub, or a bus topology, where they share a single communication line. Key devices include routers, which direct data traffic, and switches, which facilitate communication between devices. Protocols like TCP/IP serve as the rules for how data is exchanged, while security measures like firewalls protect against cyber threats and encryption keeps our data safe. Managing these networks involves monitoring their performance to ensure everything runs smoothly. In todayâ€™s tech-driven world, understanding computer networks is essential for anyone interested in fields like IT, cybersecurity, or simply staying connected with others.</p>
