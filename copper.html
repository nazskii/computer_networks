     <h1>Copper Based Systems</h1>
     <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Copper-based systems in telecommunications use copper wires to send data and voice signals. They’ve been a standard method for a long time. When you make a phone call or connect to the internet, your information travels as electrical signals through these wires. There are different types of copper cables, like twisted pair cables for phone lines and coaxial cables for cable TV and internet.
While copper systems are generally cheaper to install and maintain, they have some limitations. They can’t handle as much data as fiber optics, and the signals can weaken over long distances. They’re also more susceptible to interference from other electronic devices. Despite these drawbacks, copper is still widely used, especially in areas where fiber optics aren’t available, making it a familiar technology for many people.</p>
       <h2>Function</h2>
     <p>Fiber-based systems in telecommunications work by sending data as light signals through thin strands of glass or plastic known as optical fibers. When you want to transmit information, it gets converted into light pulses. These pulses travel through the fiber, bouncing off the walls to keep the light moving in the right direction. This allows the signals to travel long distances without losing quality. When the light reaches its destination, it is converted back into electrical signals that devices like computers and smartphones can understand. This technology enables fast internet speeds and efficient communication over long distances.</p>
