     <h1>Copper Based Systems</h1>
     <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Copper-based systems in telecommunications use copper wires to send data and voice signals. They’ve been a standard method for a long time. When you make a phone call or connect to the internet, your information travels as electrical signals through these wires. There are different types of copper cables, like twisted pair cables for phone lines and coaxial cables for cable TV and internet.
While copper systems are generally cheaper to install and maintain, they have some limitations. They can’t handle as much data as fiber optics, and the signals can weaken over long distances. They’re also more susceptible to interference from other electronic devices. Despite these drawbacks, copper is still widely used, especially in areas where fiber optics aren’t available, making it a familiar technology for many people.</p>
       <h2>Function</h2>
     <p>Copper-based systems send data and voice signals as electrical signals through copper wires. When you want to share information, it gets turned into electrical pulses that travel along these cables. There are two main types of copper cables: twisted pair cables for phone lines and local networks, and coaxial cables for cable TV and internet. While these signals can weaken over long distances and may get interference from other devices, copper systems are still widely used, especially in places where newer technologies like fiber optics aren’t available yet. They remain a familiar part of our daily communication.</p>
