     <h1>Wired Network</h1>
     <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Wired networks are like the sturdy highways of the digital world, using physical cables—like Ethernet and fiber optic lines—to connect our devices for seamless communication. With switches acting as traffic directors and routers connecting different networks, these setups ensure that data travels quickly and reliably. Because they offer low latency and high bandwidth, wired networks are often the go-to choice for homes and businesses that need a stable and secure connection for everything from streaming movies to running complex applications.</p>
       <h2>Hardware Needed</h2>
     <p>To set up a wired network, you'll need Ethernet cables, a network switch, a router, and a modem to connect devices and access the internet. Each device requires a Network Interface Card (NIC), and additional components like a patch panel, Power over Ethernet (PoE) switches, and a firewall can enhance organization, power delivery, and security. Together, these elements facilitate effective communication and resource sharing within the network.</p>
