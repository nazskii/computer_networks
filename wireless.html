     <h1>Wireless Networks</h1>
     <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Wireless-based systems in telecommunications allow us to communicate without the hassle of cables. They use technologies like radio waves, microwaves, and infrared signals to connect our devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops, to the internet and to each other. This means we can stay connected and communicate from almost anywhere, making our lives more convenient. However, things like distance and obstacles can sometimes interfere with the signal, which might affect our connection.</p>
       <h2>Function</h2>
     <p>A wireless-based system lets us send data and voice signals through the air instead of using cables. When you want to share information, it gets turned into a radio signal by a transmitter, which then travels to a receiver. The receiver picks up the signal and converts it back into data that your device can understand. This technology allows our smartphones, tablets, and laptops to connect to the internet and communicate with each other from just about anywhere. However, things like distance, obstacles, and interference from other devices can sometimes affect the quality of the connection.</p>
