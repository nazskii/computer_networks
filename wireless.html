 <h1>Wireless Network</h1>
     <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>A wireless network is a communication system that allows devices to connect to the internet and each other without the need for physical cables, using radio waves or infrared signals. This type of network provides flexibility and mobility, enabling users to access the network from various locations within its coverage area. Wireless networks are commonly used in homes, offices, and public spaces, offering convenience and ease of installation while supporting a wide range of devices.</p>
       <h2>Hardware Needed</h2>
     <p>To set up a wireless network, you'll need a wireless router to connect to your ISP and enable internet access for multiple devices. A modem may also be required for certain connections, along with access points to extend coverage in larger areas. Additionally, wireless network interface cards (NICs) are necessary for devices without built-in wireless capability, and Ethernet cables are used for wired connections. For security, consider using firewalls and surge protectors to safeguard your network and equipment.</p>
