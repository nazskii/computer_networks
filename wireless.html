     <h1>Wireless Based Systems</h1>
     <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Wireless-based systems in telecommunications allow us to communicate without the hassle of cables. They use technologies like radio waves, microwaves, and infrared signals to connect our devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops, to the internet and to each other. This means we can stay connected and communicate from almost anywhere, making our lives more convenient. However, things like distance and obstacles can sometimes interfere with the signal, which might affect our connection.</p>
       <h2>Function</h2>
     <p>Fiber-based systems in telecommunications work by sending data as light signals through thin strands of glass or plastic known as optical fibers. When you want to transmit information, it gets converted into light pulses. These pulses travel through the fiber, bouncing off the walls to keep the light moving in the right direction. This allows the signals to travel long distances without losing quality. When the light reaches its destination, it is converted back into electrical signals that devices like computers and smartphones can understand. This technology enables fast internet speeds and efficient communication over long distances.</p>
